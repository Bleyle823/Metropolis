## 📜 Introduction

Welcome to **Crypto-Cartels**, a groundbreaking project that explores the dynamics of monopolies within the blockchain ecosystem. Our goal is to shed light on how power and control can be consolidated in decentralized networks, and how this affects the broader crypto landscape.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Educate** users about the concept of monopolies in blockchain.
- **Develop** tools and metrics to measure and visualize the level of centralization in different crypto ecosystems.

## 🔍 What is a Monopoly in Blockchain?

In traditional economics, a monopoly occurs when a single entity dominates a market, stifling competition and innovation. In the blockchain world, a monopoly can emerge when:

- A single mining pool controls a majority of the network's hash rate.
- A few entities hold a significant portion of a cryptocurrency's total supply.
- Development and decision-making are centralized within a small group.
